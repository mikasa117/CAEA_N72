/* module specific MISRA deviations:

 MD_TpMC_0488:    Performing pointer arithmetic.
      Reason:     Pointer arithmemtic is required to efficiently navigate inside of arrays of payload. This is required for the internal memcpy. 
                  It is as well required for methods interacting with upper and lower layers of the TpMC in order to exchanged payload data 
                  (MISRA RULE 17.4 VIOLATION: Performing pointer arithmetic.)
      Risk:       There is no risk.
      Prevention: Covered by code review.
      
 MD_TpMC_0489:    Increment or decrement operation performed on pointer
      Reason:     Pointer arithmemtic is required to efficiently navigate inside of arrays of payload. This is required for the internal memcpy. 
                  It is as well required for methods interacting with upper and lower layers of the TpMC in order to exchanged payload data 
                  (MISRA RULE 17.4 VIOLATION: Performing pointer arithmetic.)
      Risk:       There is no risk.
      Prevention: Covered by code review.

 MD_TpMC_3333:    A break statement is being used to exit from a switch case block but is not the final statement in the block.
      Reason:     The Vector code size optimization requires the if-else-structure with and withouts breaks exactly as is. 
      Risk:       There is no risk.
      Prevention: Covered by code review.

 MD_TpMC_3684:    Array declared with unknown size.
      Reason:     In file tp_par.c is declared without size specification since their size depend on the configuration in GENy. 
                  This kind of declaration is required to have library capability of this component.
      Risk:       There is no risk.
      Prevention: Covered by code review. 

 MD_TpMC_6080:    Number maximum nesting of control structures defined by HIS shall be in range 0..4
      Reason:     Function handles specific task in the overall component behavior; task has different 
                  scenarios to cover depending on local conditions - this results in deep nesting of con-
                  trol structures. Due to there is more common than different code, higher nesting level 
                  is accepted to keep code footprint small.
      Risk:       Code is difficult to maintain.
      Prevention: Covered by code review.

 MD_TpMC_6010:    Estimated static path count defined by HIS shall be in range 1..80
      Reason:     No separation of functionality into sub-functions due to higher voted requirements for 
                  minimized stack and runtime usage applied on the code.
      Risk:       Understandability and testability might become too complex.
      Prevention: Covered by code review.

 MD_TpMC_3356:    The result of this logical operation is always 'false'.
      Reason:     In some configurations the logical operation is always 'false'.
      Risk:       None.
      Prevention: Covered by code review.

 MD_TpMC_3359:    The value of this control expression is always 'false'.
      Reason:     In some configurations the control expression is always 'false'.
      Risk:       None.
      Prevention: Covered by code review.

 MD_TpMC_3673:    The object addressed by the pointer parameter 'rxStruct' is not modified and so the pointer could be of type 'pointer to const'.
      Reason:     In some configurations, the parameter rxStruct is given as input when calling further functions
                  (e.g., the functions behind the __ApplTpPrecopy macro). Using a 'pointer to const' without adapting these functions would result
                  in warnings similar to: warning C4090: 'function' : different 'const' qualifiers (from the MSVC compiler) and [C] Pointer
                  argument has differently qualified base type (from QAC).
      Risk:       None.
      Prevention: Covered by code review.

 MD_TpMC_3408:    'TpPrecopy*' has external linkage but is being defined without any previous declaration.
      Reason:     The driver declares only the functions that it actually uses. Any other declaration by the TP would
                  trigger warnings because there would be more than one declaration for some functions.
      Risk:       None.
      Prevention: Covered by code review.
